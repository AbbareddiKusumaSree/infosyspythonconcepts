# Dataset Loading and Sampling

Dataset Acquisition
Dataset acquisition is the first step in any data science project. For air quality forecasting, having the right dataset is crucial.
Sources of Data
CPCB (Central Pollution Control Board):
Provides government-collected air quality data across India. It includes pollutants such as PM2.5, PM10, NO₂, SO₂, O₃, CO measured at different stations.
OpenAQ (Open Air Quality):
A global open-source platform that aggregates air quality data from multiple providers. This ensures you can access data from different cities and countries.
Dataset Structure
Usually, the dataset contains:
Date/Time → When the reading was taken.
Location → City, state, or monitoring station.
Pollutant Levels → PM2.5, PM10, NO₂, SO₂, O₃, CO, etc.
Meteorological Data (sometimes included) → Temperature, humidity, wind speed.
Challenges in Raw Data
Missing values due to faulty sensors.
Different units of measurement.
Multiple formats (CSV, JSON, APIs).
Feature Engineering & Resampling
After cleaning and analyzing the dataset, we transform it into a format that forecasting models can learn from. This step is called feature engineering.
Resampling
Air quality data may come in different frequencies (e.g., every minute, every hour).
To make analysis easier, we resample data into uniform time intervals:
Hourly averages (short-term trend analysis).
Daily averages (medium-term forecasting).
Monthly averages (long-term seasonal forecasting).
Feature Engineering Techniques
Lag Features:
Pollution levels today are often influenced by previous days.
Rolling Statistics:
Smoothens short-term fluctuations.
Time-based Features:
Extract hour, day, month, season, weekday/weekend from the timestamp.
Pollutant Ratios & Interactions:
Ratios like PM2.5/PM10 may indicate pollution source.
Interaction features (e.g., combining NO₂ and CO) can help models capture correlations.
