**Strings in Python**

A string (str) is a sequence of characters enclosed in single quotes
(\'), double quotes (\"), or triple quotes (\'\'\' or \"\"\").

Strings in Python are immutable (cannot be changed after creation).

# Indexing in Python

-   Indexing means accessing elements of a sequence (like strings,
    lists, tuples) by their position number.

-   In Python, indexing starts from 0 for the first element.

-   Negative indexing starts from -1 for the last element.

**1. Positive Indexing**

-   First element → index 0

-   Second element → index 1

-   And so on...

text = \"PYTHON\"

print(text\[0\]) \# \'P\'

print(text\[1\]) \# \'Y\'

print(text\[5\]) \# \'N\'

**2. Negative Indexing**

-   Last element → index -1

-   Second last element → index -2

-   And so on...

text = \"PYTHON\"

print(text\[-1\]) \# \'N\'

print(text\[-2\]) \# \'O\'

print(text\[-6\]) \# \'P\'

# Slicing in Python

-   **Slicing** means extracting a part (substring, sublist, subtuple,
    etc.) from a sequence.

-   Works on **strings, lists, tuples, and other sequence types**.

-   General syntax:

sequence\[start : stop : step\]

**Parameters**

-   **start** → Index where slice begins (default = 0).

-   **stop** → Index where slice ends (excluded).

-   **step** → Interval between elements (default = 1).
