#  Python Variables

In Python, variables are used to store data that can be referenced and
manipulated during program execution. A variable is essentially a name
that is assigned to a value.

The type of the variable is inferred based on the value assigned.

They allow us to store and reuse values in our program.

**Example:**

\# Variable \'x\' stores the integer value 5

x = 5

\# Variable \'name\' stores the string \"Kusumasree\"

name = \"Kusumasree\"

print(x)

print(name)

**Rules for Naming Variables**

To use variables effectively, we must follow Python's naming rules:

-   Variable names can only contain letters, digits and underscores
    (\_).

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   A variable name cannot start with a digit.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Variable names are case-sensitive (myVar and myvar are different).

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Avoid using **[Python
    keywords](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python/python-keywords/) **(e.g., if, else, for)
    as variable names.

**Example:**

age = 21

\_colour = \"blue\"

total_score = 90

#  Python Keywords

1.  **Keywords** are reserved words in Python that have special meaning.

2.  You **cannot use them as identifiers** (variable names, function
    names, etc.).

3.  They define the syntax and structure of the Python language.
