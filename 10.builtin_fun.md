What are Built-in Functions

Built-in functions are predefined functions provided by Python that you
can use directly without having to define them yourself.\
They are part of the Python standard library and are available by
default.

Example of built-in functions:

-   print() → displays output

-   len() → returns length of a sequence

-   max() / min() → find largest or smallest value

-   type() → returns the type of a variable

-   sum() → returns the sum of a list/tuple

**Use Cases of Built-in Functions**

We use built-in functions whenever we want to perform **common
operations quickly** without writing extra code.

**Input/Output** → print(), input()\
**Mathematical operations** → abs(), pow(), round()\
**Working with collections** → len(), sorted(), sum(), any(), all()\
**Type conversions** → int(), float(), str(), list(), dict()\
**Checking object properties** → isinstance(), id(), dir()

**Advantages of Built-in Functions**

1.  **Saves time** → No need to write code from scratch for common
    tasks.

2.  **Reliable & Tested** → They are already optimized and tested by
    Python developers.

3.  **Readable & Clean code** → Makes code shorter and easier to
    understand.

4.  **Performance** → Usually faster than custom implementations, since
    they are written in C (under the hood).

**Where Do We Use Them?**

-   In **data analysis** → sum(), max(), len() for handling datasets.

-   In **string operations** → upper(), lower(), split(), join().

-   In **loops & conditions** → any(), all(), enumerate(), range().

-   In **type conversions** → while handling user input (int(input())).

-   In **everyday coding** → practically in almost all Python programs.

Example Program Using Built-in Functions:

numbers = \[5, 2, 9, 1\]

print(\"Length:\", len(numbers)) \# 4

print(\"Maximum:\", max(numbers)) \# 9

print(\"Minimum:\", min(numbers)) \# 1

print(\"Sum:\", sum(numbers)) \# 17

print(\"Sorted:\", sorted(numbers)) \# \[1, 2, 5, 9\]
