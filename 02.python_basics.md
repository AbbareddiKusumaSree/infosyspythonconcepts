# 1. What is Software? 

Software is a collection of programs, instructions, and data that tell a

computer how to perform specific tasks.

***Types of Software:***

1\. System Software

2.Application Software

3.Programming Software

# 2. What is Programming? 

Programming is the process of writing instructions (code) in a
programming language that a computer can understand and execute.

# 3. What is Python? 

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language created by
Guido

van Rossum in 1991.

It is known for its simplicity, readability, and productivity.

# Indentation in Python 

In Python, Indentation is used to define blocks of code. It tells the
Python

interpreter that a group of statements belongs to a specific block. All

statements with the same level of indentation are considered part of the

same block.
