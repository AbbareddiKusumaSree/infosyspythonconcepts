# Loops in Python

Loops in Python are used to repeat actions efficiently. The main types
are For loops (counting through items) and While loops (based on
conditions)

**for Loop**

A for loop is used to **iterate over a sequence** (list, string, range,
etc.) and execute a block of code for each element.

Example:\
for i in range(5):

print(i)\
Output:

0

1

2

3

4

**while Loop**

A while loop repeats a block of code **as long as the condition is
True.**

**Example:**

count = 1

while count \<= 5:

print(count)

count += 1

Output:

1

2

3

4

5

**Nested Loop**

A nested loop means **a loop inside another loop**, useful for working
with grids or repeated patterns.

Example:

for i in range(3): \# outer loop

for j in range(2): \# inner loop

print(i, j)

Output:

0 0

0 1

1 0

1 1

2 0

2 1

**break Statement**

The break statement is used to **exit a loop immediately**, even if the
condition is not yet False.

Example:

for i in range(10):

if i == 5:

break

print(i)

Output:

0

1

2

3

4

**5. continue Statement**

-   Used to **skip the current iteration** and move to the next.

Example:

for i in range(5):

if i == 2:

continue

print(i)

Output:

0

1

3

4
